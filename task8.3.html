    <h3><b><u>French fries</u></b></h3>
    <h5><p>A food trend that perhaps should have died a few years ago, truffle fries are made with truffle oil, which contains no real truffles and gives the genuine article a bad rap. The flavor is plasticky and reminiscent of dirty socks especially if the chef decides to drown the fries out with the oil.
